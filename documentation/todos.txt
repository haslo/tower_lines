✓ * Get sprites to draw at all
✓ * Get map working (drawing left-half or center, knowing its coordinates)
  * Get sprites to draw on map (with relative coords and scaling)
  * Build structures for map knowledge (position and direction of towers and mobs)
  * Get engine to redraw instead of just draw, prepare for animation, screen resizes, reloads
  * Build pathing algorithms for mobs, get mobs to walk
  * Implement basic shots with basic collision detection (point-based)
  * Add state to mobs beyond position and class (health, mostly) and make them die when hit hard enough
  * Display health bars for mobs
