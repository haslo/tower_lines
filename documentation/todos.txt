# ToDos

## Basic Engine

✓ * Get sprites to draw at all
✓ * Get map working (drawing left-half or center, knowing its coordinates)
✓ * Get sprites to draw relative to map (with relative coords and scaling)
✓ * Build structures for map knowledge (position and direction of towers, mobs, paths)
✓ * Fix pixel scaling for line drawings
  * Prepare offscreen rendering and sprite generation
  * Use in-engine structures for rendering tree where possible (for optimization)
  * Make it possible to draw images instead of line art
  * Get engine to redraw instead of just draw, prepare for animation, screen resizes ✓, reloads ✓
  * Build pathing algorithms for mobs, get mobs to walk
  * Implement basic shots with basic collision detection (point-based)
  * Add state to mobs beyond position and class (health, mostly) and make them die when hit hard enough
  * Display health bars for mobs

## Further progress

  * Conceptualize framework for server communication
  * Conceptualize menu framework
  * Conceptualize framework for planning "programs"
  * Conceptualize player progress and tutorials
